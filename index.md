### Research

I am a PhD candidate at Osgoode Hall Law School and refugee lawyer. 

I have two broad research agendas. First, how can legal research be enriched with computational methodologies? Inspiried by the computational study of literature, I aim to develop methods to read a jurisprudence at scale. For example, if a tribunal issues 20,000 decisions a year, I aim to find a way to read and render conclusions about the tribunal's total jurisprudence.

Second, as a "crimmigration" lawyer, I am interested in the function and use of Canadian deportation law. I research Canadian inadmissibility law, administrative law, and the history of Canadian immigration law (1893 to 1914).

### Open source contributions

I am the developer of [obiter.ai](https://www.obiter.ai), an open-source toolkit for legal researchers. This is a Python package that can be used to facilitate computational analyses of Canadian case law, analyze speech, and assess the gendered valances of names found within text.

To track linguistic trends at the Supreme Court of Canada, I developed [benchbabble.ca](https://www.benchbabble.ca).

### Background as a litigator

Out of law school, I opened my own practice as a refugee, [tenants'](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/02/08/parkdale-tenants-take-to-the-street-to-fight-rent-hike.html) [rights](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/friday-detroit-water-update-roma-attack-swedish-real-estate-company-and-more-1.2903412/toronto-s-parkdale-residents-fear-radical-gentrification-as-european-company-buys-up-thousands-of-apartments-1.2903419), and [prisoners' rights](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2019/2019scc29/2019scc29.html?autocompleteStr=chhina&autocompletePos=1) lawyer.

From 2019 to 2020, I worked at the Refugee Law Office (Legal Aid Ontario) as its first full-time immigration detention staff lawyer. Based out of Toronto's _Immigration Holding Centre_, I assisted migrants with  immigration detention matters and represented detainees on eleventh-hour motions to stay their deportations. 

I have advanced significant litigation regarding the use of solitary confinement, the limits of the state's power to detain migrants, and the government's obligations to disclose exculpatory evidence to detainees.
