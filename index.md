### Research

I am a PhD student at Osgoode Hall Law School and refugee lawyer. 

I have two broad research agendas. First, how can legal research be enriched with computational methodologies? Inspiried by the computational study of literature, I aim to develop methods to read a jurisprudence at scale. For example, if a tribunal issues 20,000 decisions a year, I aim to find a way to read and render conclusions about the tribunal's total jurisprudence.

Second, as a "crimmigration" lawyer, I am interested in the function and use of Canadian deportation law. I research Canadian inadmissibility law, administrative law, and the history of Canadian immigration law (1893 to 1914).

### Open source contributions

I am the developer of [obiter.ai](www.obiter.ai), an open-source toolkit for legal researchers. This is a Python package that can be used to facilitate computational analyses of Canadian case law, analyze speech, and assess the gendered valances of names found within text.

### Background as a litigator

Out of law school, I opened my own practice as a refugee, [tenants'](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/02/08/parkdale-tenants-take-to-the-street-to-fight-rent-hike.html) [rights](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/friday-detroit-water-update-roma-attack-swedish-real-estate-company-and-more-1.2903412/toronto-s-parkdale-residents-fear-radical-gentrification-as-european-company-buys-up-thousands-of-apartments-1.2903419), and [prisoners' rights](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2019/2019scc29/2019scc29.html?autocompleteStr=chhina&autocompletePos=1) lawyer.

From 2019 to 2020, I worked at the Refugee Law Office (Legal Aid Ontario) as its first full-time immigration detention staff lawyer. Based out of Toronto's _Immigration Holding Centre_, I assisted migrants with  immigration detention matters and represented detainees on eleventh-hour motions to stay their deportations. 

I have advanced significant litigation regarding the use of solitary confinement, the limits of the state's power to detain migrants, and the government's obligations to disclose exculpatory evidence to detainees.
