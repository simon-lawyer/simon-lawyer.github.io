### Research

I am a PhD student at Osgoode Hall Law School, working with [Prof. Sean Rehaag](https://www.osgoode.yorku.ca/faculty-and-staff/rehaag-sean/). I am a researcher at the [Refugee Law Labratory](https://refugeelab.ca). 

I have two broad research agendas. First, I use cutting-edge AI and natural language processing models to read caselaw at scale. My objective is to develop analytic methods to allow legal researchers to draw empirical conclusions about law's shape. For example, if a tribunal issues 20,000 decisions a year, I aim to find a way to read and render conclusions about the tribunal's total jurisprudence.

Second, as a "crimmigration" lawyer, I am interested in the function and use of Canadian deportation law. I research Canadian inadmissibility law, administrative law, and the history of Canadian immigration law (specifically 1899 to 1914).

### Background as a litigator

Out of law school, I opened my own practice as a refugee, [tenants'](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/02/08/parkdale-tenants-take-to-the-street-to-fight-rent-hike.html) [rights](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/friday-detroit-water-update-roma-attack-swedish-real-estate-company-and-more-1.2903412/toronto-s-parkdale-residents-fear-radical-gentrification-as-european-company-buys-up-thousands-of-apartments-1.2903419), and [prisoners' rights](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2019/2019scc29/2019scc29.html?autocompleteStr=chhina&autocompletePos=1) lawyer.

From 2019 to 2020, I worked at the Refugee Law Office (Legal Aid Ontario) as its first full-time immigration detention staff lawyer. Based out of Toronto's _Immigration Holding Centre_, I assisted migrants with  immigration detention matters and represented detainees on eleventh-hour motions to stay their deportations. 

I have advanced significant litigation regarding the use of solitary confinement, the limits of the state's power to detain migrants, and the government's obligations to disclose exculpatory evidence to detainees.
